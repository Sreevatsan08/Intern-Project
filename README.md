This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models including multiple linear regression, k-NN classifier, sentiment analysis, and a YOLO model for detecting the top 10 famous people. Each model is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

Multiple Linear Regression: This implementation uses the statsmodels library to perform a multiple linear regression analysis on a dataset, predicting sales based on TV, radio, and newspaper advertising spends.

k-NN Classifier: This script implements a k-nearest neighbors classifier using the scikit-learn library, applied to the digits dataset for digit classification.

Sentiment Analysis: This code uses logistic regression to perform sentiment analysis on text data, vectorizing the text using CountVectorizer and evaluating the model's performance.

YOLO Model for Top 10 Famous People: This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to detect and recognize the top 10 famous people in images. The model is trained on a custom dataset containing labeled images of these celebrities and is capable of real-time object detection and recognition.
